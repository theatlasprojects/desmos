# Desmos

This is a small project dedicated to sharing my work for certain courses.

The website is built using Next.js and React frameworks in order to create a visually appealing interface, mainly for practice and for fun.

**DISCLAIMER:** This project is not intended for any academic misconduct, but rather as a way to share work in a simplified form and learn from one another.
